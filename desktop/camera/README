### RealSense

- apply rgb align after post-processing to avoid aliasing distortion
- adjusting depth scale
`depth_sensor.set_option(rs.option.depth_units, 0.001)`

Pixel Coordinates
- [0, 0] - topleft
- [w-1, h-1] - bottomright

Point Coordinates
- 3d space
- in meters

Intrinsic camera parameters
- defined in rs2_intrinsics struct
- size
    - width, height
- field of view
    - The fx and fy fields describe the focal length of the image, as a multiple of pixel width and height
- The pixels of an image are not necessarily square
    - The fx and fy fields are allowed to be different (though they are commonly close)
- The center of projection is not necessarily the center of the image
    - The ppx and ppy fields describe the pixel coordinates of the principal point (center of projection)
- The image may contain distortion
    - The model field describes which of several supported distortion models was 
        used to calibrate the image, and the coeffs field provides an array of up to 
        five coefficients describing the distortion model.
    - Modified Brown-Conrady distortion
        - used by the D415's color image system
        - This model provides a closed-form formula to map from undistorted points to distorted points, 
            while mapping in the other direction requires iteration or lookup tables. 
        - Therefore, images with Modified Brown-Conrady Distortion are being 
            undistorted when calling rs2_project_point_to_pixel(...)
                - O(n)
mapping operations
    - Projection
        - rs2_project_point_to_pixel(...)
    - Deprojection
        - rs2_deproject_pixel_to_point(...)
            - input
                - 2D pixel location
                - a depth, in meters
            - output
                - a 3D point location within the stream's associated 
                    3D coordinate space.

depth scale:0.001000

RealSense devices always support 
    deprojection from depth images, and always 
    support projection to color images.
    - always possible to map a 
        depth image into a set of 3D points (a point cloud)
    - always possible to discover where a 3D 
        object would appear on the color image.
point cloud
    - a set of 3D points

extrinsic camera parameters
- The relationship between the separate 3D 
    coordinate systems of separate streams is described by 
    their extrinsic parameters, contained 
    in the rs2_extrinsics struct. 

Depth image formats
- Depth is stored as one unsigned 16-bit integer per 
    pixel, mapped linearly to depth in camera-specific units. 
- The distance, in meters, corresponding to one integer increment in depth values 
    can be queried via rs2_get_depth_scale(...) or using a rs2::depth_sensor via get_depth_scale()

Adjust depth scale (CAUTION)
- rs2_set_option(...) with RS2_OPTION_DEPTH_UNITS, which 
    specifies the number of meters per one increment of depth. 0.001 would indicate 
    millimeter scale, while 0.01 would indicate centimeter scale.
